# lib-SHT
Sensirion SHT30-D, SHT31-D, SHT35-D, SHT40/41/45 ESP32/Arduino library

This library uses the TwoWireDevice base class present in lib-TwoWireDevice

At this point the SHT3x and SHT4x libraries are still separate files. Thanks to Edwin @ uva.nl for porting the SHT3x code to SHT4x.

# Sensor types:
SHT30-D Least Accurate version  
SHT31-D: Most Accurrate version over the whole range (90% RH)  
SHT35-D: slight reduced accuracy, mostly smaller accurate range (80% RH)  
SHT40: Gen 4, little more accurate, less power, smaller package, no alert, single address
SHT41/45: No specs given yet
